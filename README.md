# RagLLM

## Overview
RagLLM is a library aimed at developing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) application. This method enhances the capabilities of standard LLMs by integrating external data sources, enabling more accurate and context-specific responses.

## Key Features
- **RAG Integration**: Enhances LLMs by combining them with external data sources.
- **Scalability**: Designed for large datasets and compute-intensive workloads.
- **Source Referencing**: Includes source references in responses for transparency.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: Process data sources to create a vector database.
2. **Content Extraction**: Extract content from data sources.
3. **Chunk Creation**: Split content into smaller, manageable chunks.
4. **Embedding**: Embed data chunks and queries using pre-trained models.
5. **Indexing**: Store embedded chunks in a vector database.
6. **Query Processing**: Retrieve relevant chunks for incoming queries.
7. **Response Generation**: Generate LLM responses using retrieved context.
8. **Query Agent**: Combine retrieval and generation processes into a single agent.

## Experimentation
Experimentation with various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Llama) is a part of the development process.

## Conclusion
RagLLM facilitates the adoption and utilization of LLMs with specific data sources, improving response accuracy and relevance.
